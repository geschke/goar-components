# goar-components Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to goar-components! This Vue.js component library follows the design standards of Bootstrap. It was initially part of a larger project, but was extracted to make it usable in other projects.

The idea for goar-components emerged during a Vue.js project when a table component that adhered to Bootstrap's design standards was needed. Existing components often had unique styles or required significant customization to fit into the project. The goal was to create a library that worked without extensive CSS adjustments or additional styling.

The resulting components rely heavily on Bootstrap's existing design, minimizing custom CSS definitions. This approach ensures that the components can be seamlessly integrated into various projects without altering the overall design.

Though many component libraries are available, goar-components was created to meet specific needs. Expansion is planned in the future as new components are developed or additional functionality is required.
